## React Flickr Gallery

In this project, I built an image gallery using React and the Flickr API.

- I used the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
- Displayed 3 links that return a list of photos matching Dogs, Cats and Computers.
- "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
- React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
- I used the Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
- The App component fetch data and passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images
